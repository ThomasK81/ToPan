# (Meletē)ToPān v.0.5.1 "The Knights Who Say t-SNE"

The name (Meletē)ToPān v.0.5 is based on the Greek principle μελέτη τὸ πᾶν which roughly translate to "take into care everything". I decided for the name because Topic-Modelling performs well on large amounts of logically structured chunks of texts and it helps selecting the interesting bits in a large corpus of text by technically having looked at everything. The butterfly in the logo is of the species Melete. The original photograph is by Didier Descouens and he has licensed it under CC BY-SA 4.0. I changed the image for the logo slightly. I'd strongly suggest to start with the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Melete_leucadia_MHNT_dos.jpg" target="_blank">original</a> if you want to use it, but you can also use this now slightly modified logo under CC BY-SA 4.0 license as I am required to share it under the same license as the original image.

ToPān is Topic-Modelling for everyone: from people without programming knowledge to people that want to build teaching and text-reuse tools and apps based on Topic-Modelling data without having to develop their own tool or having to majorly restructure their textual data. ToPān is made to be shared and used. That is why I tried to modularise ToPān in a way that in each step you could ingest your own data. It works best however, if you work your way from left to right: from "Data Input" to "LDA Tables" (please find more details under "Instructions"). ToPān works best with files that are structured according to the <a href="http://cite-architecture.github.io" target="_blank">CTS/CITE architecture</a>.

ToPān is also still under active development. This is an alpha release. More features will be added and you are encouraged to roadtest ToPān and send me feedback or report bugs.

*Technical Note: ToPān is written in RShiny and uses the following R-libraries: shiny, RCurl (also I mainly switch to httr, because of RCurl's mysterious errors and performance issues when sending lots and lots of requests), XML (but also install XML2), httr (and curl), lda, LDAvis. If you want to install a local version of ToPān, simply clone the  <a href="https://github.com/ThomasK81/ToPan" target="_blank">repo</a>, install R, RStudio, and the mentioned libraries and Bob's your uncle.*

## Trying it (running it from the GitHub Repo)

1. Install [R](https://www.r-project.org) and optionally [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)
2. In RStudio/R install some packages you will need: `install.packages("shiny"); install.packages("LDAvis"); install.packages("XML"); install.packages("xml2"); install.packages("RCurl"); install.packages("httr"); install.packages("lda"); install.packages("servr"); install.packages("markdown"); install.packages("data.table"); install.packages("stringr"); install.packages("plyr"); install.packages("ggplot2"); install.packages("jsonlite"); install.packages("tsne")` 
3. `library(shiny)`
4. `runUrl("https://github.com/ThomasK81/ToPan/archive/master.zip")`
5. Enjoy!
